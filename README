Hello!!
A guide to our code:
We are using a heap and an unordered map for our two primary data structures
HEAP:
    In main, enter the poverty rate you want to use as the baseline or leave our standard 7% as is
        You would switch it in the if else statements (wherever you see a greater than or less than value)
    To start, change the file path to wherever you saved the Excel sheet with the data
    Then in find where the code reads
        find_town_info(locations, "1001020600.00");
        cout <<endl;
        heap.extractMax();
    Change the town number if you desire to look for a different region, alternative numbers are in the Excel sheet
    You can also remove extract max if you would like, we mostly use it to verify it has parsed all the files
    From here move to the Python Program "data_visuals"
    Change the file paths to match what they are saved on to your computer and then you can visualize the poverty rates
    and their relationship with food deserts

MAP:
    In main, enter the poverty rate you want to use as the baseline or leave our standard 7% as is
            You would switch it in the if else statements (wherever you see a greater than or less than value) that are
            listed in the search() method.
        To start, change the file path to wherever you saved the Excel sheet with the data
        Then in find where the code reads
            find_town_info(locations, "1001020600.00");
            cout <<endl;
            heap.extractMax();
        The census tracts are sorted by county but you can also sort them by state, food access, or any other data point
        very easily by changing what gets sent in as a key to the map. However, note that the map in the class is named
        "counties".
        Change the file paths to match what they are saved on to your computer and then you can visualize the poverty
        rates and their relationship with food deserts
